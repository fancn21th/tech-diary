- The progress on the AI Components' design system has stalled since June 17th. Although the design decisions have been delegated to the team, they have yet to reach a conclusion. This situation reminds me of a line from 'The Last Samurai,' where the son of the rebel generals tells the lead character, 'Too many minds.'

Our goal is to create a UI library that addresses the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) problem while also establishing a standardized approach to AI component delivery for the team. This library will draw inspiration from open-source AI libraries, such as:

* [Ant Design](https://x.ant.design/docs/react/introduce-cn)
* [Assistant UI](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui)
* [OpenCanvas](https://opencanvas.langchain.com/)

By combining these insights, we aim to provide a robust, reusable solution that ensures consistency and efficiency across AI-driven interfaces.
