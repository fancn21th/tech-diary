- The progress on the AI Components' design system has stalled since June 17th. Although the design decisions have been delegated to the team, they have yet to reach a conclusion.

- Our goal is to create a UI library that addresses the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) problem while also establishing a standardized approach to AI component delivery for the team. This library will draw inspiration from open-source AI libraries, such as:

  * [Ant Design](https://x.ant.design/docs/react/introduce-cn)

    - how to use
      - Atomic Components (react ui components) + Model Inference Services (react hooks)

  * [Assistant UI](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui)

    - how to use

  * [OpenCanvas](https://opencanvas.langchain.com/)
